type: [0x66, 0x32]
data: block-index
```

 `BlockIndex` stores relative offsets to each compressed block entry. The
 format is:

	block-index := starting-number | index | index | index ... | count

 starting-number is the first block number in the archive. Every index is a
 defined relative to index's location in the file. The total number of block
 entries in the file is recorded in count.
