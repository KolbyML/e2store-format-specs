# Version

```
type: [0x65, 0x32]
```

The `version` type must be the first record in the file. Its type is `[0x65, 0x32]` (`e2` in ascii) and the length of its data field is always 0, thus the first 8 bytes of an `e2s` file are always `[0x65, 0x32, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]`.

When a new version record is encountered, it applies to all records following the version entry - this can happen when two e2s files are concatenated.
