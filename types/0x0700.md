# Accumulator

```
type: [0x07, 0x00]
data: accumulator-root
```

 Accumulator is computed by constructing an SSZ list of header-records of length at most
 8192 and then calculating the hash_tree_root of that list.

	header-record := { block-hash: Bytes32, total-difficulty: Uint256 }
	accumulator   := hash_tree_root([]header-record, 8192)
