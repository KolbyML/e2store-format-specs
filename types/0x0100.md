# CompressedSignedBeaconBlock

```
type: [0x01, 0x00]
data: snappyFramed(ssz(SignedBeaconBlock))
```

`CompressedSignedBeackBlock` contain `SignedBeaconBlock` objects encoded using `SSZ` then compressed using the snappy [framing format](https://github.com/google/snappy/blob/master/framing_format.txt).

The encoding matches that of the `BeaconBlocksByRoot` and `BeaconBlocksByRange` requests from the p2p specification.

The fork and thus the exact format of the `SignedBeaconBlock` should be derived from the `slot`.
