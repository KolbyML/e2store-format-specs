# CompressedBeaconState

```
type: [0x02, 0x00]
data: snappyFramed(ssz(BeaconState))
```

`CompressedBeaconState` entries contain a `BeaconState`, and are encoded the same way as `CompressedSignedBeaconBlock`.

The fork and thus the exact format of the `BeaconState` should be derived from the `slot`.
