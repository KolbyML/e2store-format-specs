# SlotIndex

```
type: [0x69, 0x32]
data: starting-slot | index | index | index ... | count
```

`SlotIndex` records store offsets, in bytes, from the beginning of the index record to the beginning of the corresponding data at that slot. An offset of `0` indicates that no data is present for the given slot.

Each entry in the slot index is a fixed-length 8-byte two's complement signed integer in little-endian, meaning that the entry for slot `N` can be found at index `(N * 8) + 16` in the index. The length of a `SlotIndex` record can be computed as `count * 8 + 24` - one entry for every slot and 8 bytes each for type header, starting slot and count. In particular, knowing where the slot index ends allows finding its beginning as well.

Only one entry per slot is supported, meaning that only one canonical history can be indexed this way.

A `SlotIndex` record may appear in a stand-alone file which by convention ends with `.e2i` - in this case, the offset is counted as if the index was appened to its corresponding data file - offsets are thus negative and counted from the end of the data file. In particular, if the index is simply appended to the data file, it does not change in contents.
